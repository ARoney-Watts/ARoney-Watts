                review platform and contains solutions to potential issues or
                uncertainties that could arise in the future throughout development,
                maintenance, growth, or general use.</p>

            <p> This is an extreemely low budget prototype for the
                USC Food Forum app where the user goes in anonymously 
                to search for their favorite food and is able to see 
                reviews from others and potentially create one themselves. </p>
